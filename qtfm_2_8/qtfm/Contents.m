% quaternion is a Matlab class library designed to extend Matlab in as
% natural a way as possible to handle quaternions. From version 2.0 onwards
% the library also provides an octonion class, but this should be used with
% caution, and remains somewhat experimental. See the online help for
% further details (accessed from the Matlab Documentation under
% Supplemental Software from Matlab version 8 onwards, or from the Start
% Menu in earlier versions).
